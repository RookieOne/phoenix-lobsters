# Phoenix Lobsters is the most fun you will ever have learning a new framework

A few quick questions...

**Want to learn Phoenix?**

**Want to help others learn Phoenix?**

**Do you like to laugh?**

If you answered yes to any of those questions, then join us for laughs and learning every Thursday from 2pm - 4pm CST at [http://meeting.phoenixlobsters.com](http://meeting.phoenixlobsters.com).

While we can't guarantee it is the fastest way to learn Phoenix, it has to be one of the funnest.

# What is Phoenix Lobsters all about?

Phoenix Lobsters is a project started by @crertel and @rookieone to recreate [Lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs/) using Phoenix. There is no due date, there is no deliverable, just plenty of time to learn Phoenix. 

Phoenix is a web framework written in Elixir. We both love Elixir the language and enjoy our time working with Phoenix immensely.

Our this project we did some discovery at the beginning and put what we want to work on in GitHub issues. We then pick items to work on every week and live pair program. We try to challenge ourselves to write the best code and to do things right. Tests, documentation, and trying to follow idiomatic best practices.

We create a safe, fun, friendly environment for people of all skill levels to join in learning Phoenix.

# Who are we?

Just two developers who don't take themselves too seriously. Always working with the best intentions and then laughing when something inevitably goes wrong. In the end, we love to learn and help others. Normally with warnings like.. don't do what we just did because it ended terribly.

# Who can join?

Anyone! 

**Know absolutely nothing about Phoenix and Elixir?** Great! Then you won't know if we do things wrong. 

**Are you a Erlang / Elixir demigod and down with the OTP?** Also great! You can teach us how the magic actually works and to write better code.

# Are the sessions recorded?

Yes! We hope to make bit sized sessions of our work so those who can't join live can still enjoy the work.

# Integration Testing
